# VerilogA-model-for-Binary-RRAM

This model is from the manuscript “A 578 TOPS/W RRAM-Based Binary-Convolutional Neural Network Macro for Tiny AI Edge Devices”.

*This model is based on the Vteam[1] model, developed using the Candence Virtuoso software, with a Verilog-A implementation of the applicable RRAM model.
